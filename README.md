Quest Log: "Bot or Not" — A True Tale of AI Bot Creation

Chapter I: The Template of Trials
Our brave developer (me) embarked on their first perilous journey, armed with nothing but RLGym, overconfidence, and a vague sense of purpose. “I shall forge a bot,” I declared boldly, clicking through files like a caffeinated Gandalf.

What happened next?
Instead of a simple Rocket League bot, I accidentally summoned the entire RLBot framework, ancient and arcane, as if I had whispered a cursed incantation into a command prompt. Files duplicated. Dependencies collided. Python yelled at me. The bot? Nowhere to be seen.
I didn’t create life—I created a digital spaghetti monster with no legs and an infinite boost meter.

Chapter II: The Forkening
Having barely survived the first trial (and after considering early retirement), I took a different path.
This time, I whispered to myself, “What if I… just fork it?”
And fork it I did.
I clicked that sweet, blessed “Fork” button like a seasoned hacker in a heist movie. Cloned it. Ran it.
IT. ACTUALLY. WORKED.

No dragons. No exploding dependencies. Just pure, buttery bot goodness.
It felt like skipping the dungeon and still getting the loot.

Moral of the Story:
Never underestimate the power of copy-paste sorcery.
And when AI-generated advice tells you to fork it — fork it like your rank depends on it.
