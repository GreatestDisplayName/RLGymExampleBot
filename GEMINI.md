# RLGymExampleBot - Gemini Integration

This document outlines how Gemini is being used to improve the `RLGymExampleBot` project.

## Project Overview

`RLGymExampleBot` is a Rocket League bot built using the RLGym framework. It serves as a starting point for developing and training reinforcement learning agents for Rocket League.

## How Gemini Can Help

Gemini is assisting in various aspects of this project, including:

*   **Code Quality Improvement:** Identifying and fixing Pylint issues (e.g., import order, line length, code style).
*   **Refactoring:** Improving code structure and readability.
*   **Feature Implementation:** Adding new functionalities to the GUI and core logic.
*   **Documentation:** Creating and updating project documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `troubleshooting.md`).
*   **Best Practices:** Ensuring adherence to Python best practices and conventions.

## Current Project Status

Gemini has recently completed the following tasks:

*   **Comprehensive `README.md`:** Created a detailed `README.md` file for the project.
*   **Improved Bot Configuration:** Modified `src/bot.cfg` to use the latest model by default.
*   **Refactored `load_class` function:** Simplified and made more robust the `load_class` function in `src/rlbot_support.py`.
*   **Updated `requirements.txt`:** Ensured correct package versions and removed unnecessary dependencies.
*   **Created `troubleshooting.md`:** Provided a guide for common issues.
*   **Enhanced Training Visualization:** Implemented a two-y-axis plot for rewards and losses in the GUI training tab.

## Next Steps

Gemini is currently awaiting instructions on the next feature to implement from the `plan.txt` roadmap. The remaining ideas in "Phase 4: Future Ideas" include:

*   **Model Comparison Tools:** Allow users to compare performance metrics of different models side-by-side.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization Integration:** A dedicated GUI for setting up and running hyperparameter optimization experiments.
*   **Agent vs. Agent Simulation:** Interface for running and visualizing simulations between two selected agents.
*   **Configuration Validation:** More robust validation for configuration files beyond JSON format.

Please provide specific instructions on which task to prioritize next.
