# RLGym Bot Development Plan

## Current Status
✅ Basic bot structure implemented
✅ Training infrastructure with PPO
✅ Reward system with multiple objectives
✅ Configuration management
✅ Logging and monitoring
✅ CLI interface for training/evaluation

## Next Phase Improvements

### 1. Advanced Training Features
- [ ] Implement curriculum learning with progressive difficulty
- [ ] Add self-play training mechanism
- [ ] Implement population-based training
- [ ] Add action masking for invalid moves
- [ ] Implement prioritized experience replay

### 2. Enhanced Reward System
- [ ] Add shaped rewards for aerial play
- [ ] Implement team coordination rewards
- [ ] Add ball prediction rewards
- [ ] Implement save detection system
- [ ] Add boost starving rewards

### 3. Model Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Implement attention mechanisms
- [ ] Add LSTM for temporal dependencies
- [ ] Implement multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Add vision-based observations
- [ ] Implement transformer architecture

### 4. Training Infrastructure
- [ ] Add distributed training support
- [ ] Implement hyperparameter optimization
- [ ] Add model ensemble training
- [ ] Implement continuous learning
- [ ] Add A/B testing framework

### 5. Evaluation & Monitoring
- [ ] Implement ELO rating system

- [ ] Create detailed performance dashboards
- [ ] Implement replay analysis
- [ ] Add opponent modeling

### 6. Deployment & Production
- [ ] Create Docker containers
- [ ] Add model versioning
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create automated testing pipeline

### 7. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement meta-learning
- [ ] Add transfer learning capabilities

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add type hints throughout
- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Fix config validation in config.py (remove pydantic for now)
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement basic unit tests
4. Add performance profiling
5. Create deployment scripts
